**MULTIPLE CHOICE**
1. What is the functional unit of the kidney?a. Lobuleb. Nephronc. Glomerulusd. Ureterocele
2. ANS: BThe functional unit of the kidney is the nephron.
3. REF: p. 217
4. 2. In an average person, the nephrons filter about \_\_\_\_\_ L of water out of glomerular blood each 2b. 10c. 80d. 190
   3. ANS: DThe nephrons filter about 190 L of water out of the glomerular blood each day. Only about 1 to 2 L of water is excreted in urine, so about 99% of the filtered water is reabsorbed into the tubular blood.
   4. REF: p. 217
   5. 3. Where does the formation of urine begin?a. Nephronsb. Bowman’s capsulec. Glomerulusd. Distal convoluted tubule
      4. ANS: CThe formation begins in the glomerulus, which is a tuft of capillaries surrounded by the Bowman’s capsule. Nephrons are the basic, functional unit of the kidneys. The distal convoluted tubule is where the electrolyte and acid-base balance of the blood occurs.
